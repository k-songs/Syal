    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification" >Hypertext Markup Language </a> a standardized system for
    <strong>tagging <u>text</u></strong> files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
    <p>The web has gone through many changes over the past few decades, but HTML has always been the fundamental language used to develop webpages.
       Interestingly,
      while websites have become more advanced and interactive,
      HTML has actually gotten simpler.</p>
      <img src="coding9.jpg" width="50%">"<p style="margin-top:90px;"> If you compare the source of an
      HTML5 page with a similar page written in HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0, the HTML5 page would probably contain less code.
      This is because modern HTML relies on cascading style sheets or JavaScript to format nearly all the elements within a page.</p>
